      <description>I have no idea why I have started this, well, I guess blog. I’ve toyed around with the idea that it could be something where I put information that I learn and need one spot to keep it all. I think I’ll go with that.
R programming language has also been something that I have been learning/writing in for a little while now. Ggplot2 has been a package that has been fascinating to me and learning about graphics and design is something that fills my nerdy tech bucket.</description>
