      <description>Hello, I am Scott Sabol. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a website for some time now. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really figured out what it will be about, so bear with me as random topics, work, or ideas float out into the various posts. I initially thought it would be about I feel like a late comer to this whole website/technology/coding party, but am excited to learn and pick things up as I go.</description>

      <description>I have no idea why I have started this, well, I guess blog. I’ve toyed around with the idea that it could be something where I put information that I learn and need one spot to keep it all. I think I’ll go with that.
R programming language has also been something that I have been learning/writing in for a little while now. Ggplot2 has been a package that has been fascinating to me and learning about graphics and design is something that fills my nerdy tech bucket.</description>
