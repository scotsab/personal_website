<p>I have no idea why I have started this, well, I guess blog. I’ve toyed around with the idea that it could be something where I put information that I learn and need one spot to keep it all. I think I’ll go with that.</p>
<p>R programming language has also been something that I have been learning/writing in for a little while now. Ggplot2 has been a package that has been fascinating to me and learning about graphics and design is something that fills my nerdy tech bucket. I think this first post and a series of posts will be notes, exercises, and other thoughts as I go through the <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/">ggplot2 book</a> by Hadley Wickham.</p>
<p>Oh, I have no idea how to use RMarkdown, so I guess this blog will be my trial by fire.</p>
